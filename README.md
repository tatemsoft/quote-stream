# Quote Stream

Push JSON stock quotes in real-time over web-sockets.

## Usage

**Apple Inc. (AAPL)**
### <http://localhost:4000/#AAPL>

Simply replace **AAPL** in the URL with a **valid ticker symbol**. Stock quotes are pulled from <https://www.google.com/finance> and are real-time.

## Additional Details

By default stock quotes are fetched every **5 seconds** and pushed to the client. The fetch interval can be adjusted as well as if you want the JSON response pretty-printed or not.
